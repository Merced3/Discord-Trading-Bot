what if the messages were interactable?

A message like this comes out, as per ussual:

AMD Buy Order Pending
Buy: Order fulfilled: 0.56 Bought 2 AMD put contracts. Total investment: $112.00
[ Sell All ] [ Sell 50% ]

but then bottons show up under the message (button = [btn_text]), but what if also if the order had more than 2 contracts it would do the math differently?

what if the buttons could be adaptive? 4 examples:

ex1) #each contract gets a percentage sell button
Buy: Order fulfilled: 0.56 Bought 3 AMD put contracts. Total investment: $392.00 
[ Sell All ] [ Sell 66% ] [ Sell 33% ]

ex2) 
Buy: Order fulfilled: 0.56 Bought 10 AMD put contracts. Total investment: $560.00 
[ Sell All ] [ Sell 90% ] [ Sell 80% ] [ Sell 70% ] [ Sell 60% ] [ Sell 50% ] [ Sell 40% ][ Sell 30% ] [ Sell 20% ] [ Sell 10% ]

ex3) #anything 10 contracts and above stay to a max of 10 buttons
Buy: Order fulfilled: 0.56 Bought 30 AMD put contracts. Total investment: $1,680.00 
[ Sell All ] [ Sell 90% ] [ Sell 80% ] [ Sell 70% ] [ Sell 60% ] [ Sell 50% ] [ Sell 40% ][ Sell 30% ] [ Sell 20% ] [ Sell 10% ]

ex4) #each contract gets a percentage sell button, again
Buy: Order fulfilled: 0.56 Bought 6 AMD put contracts. Total investment: $280.00 
[ Sell All ] [ Sell 80% ] [ Sell 60% ] [ Sell 40% ] [ Sell 20% ]
